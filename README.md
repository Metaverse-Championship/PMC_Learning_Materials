# PMC_Learning_Materials
Awesome repo and tutorials for getting ready for Polkadot Metaverse Championship.

__Important note:__ code is not enough alone and a plan is also not enough alone. To build a successful web3 project, it needs to fit the target ecosystem, needs to be stable and secure while being usable, userfriendly. This will be reflected in the PMC hackathon's judging criterias as well. We will have an in-depth talk at the hackathon before the 24 hours hacking begins.
